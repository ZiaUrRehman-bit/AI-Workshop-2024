'''
Explanation Step-by-Step
1. Outer Loop (for i in range(n)):

The outer loop ensures the algorithm makes multiple passes through the array.
After each pass, the largest element in the unsorted part of the array "bubbles" to its correct position at the end.

2. Inner Loop (for j in range(0, n - i - 1)):

The inner loop compares adjacent elements in the array.
n - i - 1 ensures that the already sorted elements at the end are not checked again.

3. Condition (if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]):

This checks if the current element is greater than the next element.
If true, they are swapped to maintain ascending order.

4. Swapping (arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]):

Pythonâ€™s multiple assignment syntax is used to swap the elements in one line.

5. Return Statement:

After all passes, the array is fully sorted and returned.
